        paragraphs: [
          "[A] Before the age of the smartphone, aspiring photographers had to learn how to use high-tech cameras and photographic techniques. Not everyone had cameras, and it took skill and a good eye to capture and create a great photograph. Today, with the huge range of camera apps on our smartphones, we are all amateur photographers. And pretty good ones, too: The quality of smartphone images now nearly equals that of digital cameras.",
          "[B] The new ease of photography has given us a tremendous appetite for capturing the magical and the ordinary. We are obsessed with documenting everyday moments, whether it's a shot of our breakfast, our cat - or the cat's breakfast. And rather than collect pictures in scrapbooks, we share, like, and comment on them with friends and strangers around the globe.",
          "[C] Even photojournalists are experimenting with cell phones because their near invisibility makes it easier to capture unguarded moments. The Internet also allows photojournalists to avoid traditional media. They can now act as their own publishers - reaching huge audiences via social media sites such as Instagram.",
          "[D] In the past, magazines published unforgettable photos of important people and global events that captured our imaginations. These photos had the power to change public opinion - even the course of history. But if there are fewer memorable images today, it's not because there are fewer good images: It's because there are so many.",
          "[E] Cameras are everywhere - a situation that is transforming the way we experience dramatic events. When there are major political events or natural disasters, it is ordinary citizens with cell phones - not photojournalists - who often provide the first news images.",
          "[F] As people everywhere embrace photography and the media make use of citizen journalists, professional standards appear to be shifting. In the past, most people trusted photojournalists to accurately represent reality. Today, however, digital images can be altered in ways the naked eye might never notice.",
          "[G] The question of the accuracy of images gets even trickier when photojournalists start experimenting with camera apps - like Flickr or Instagram - which encourage the use of filters. Images can be colored, brightened, faded, and scratched to make photographs more artistic, or to give them an antique look. Critics worry that antique-looking photographs romanticize war, while distancing us from those who fight in them.",
          "[H] Yet, photography has always been more subjective than we assume. Each picture is a result of a series of decisions - where to stand, what lens to use, and what to leave in or out of the frame. Does altering photographs with camera app filters make them less true?",
          "[I] There's something powerful and exciting about the experiment that the digital age has forced upon us. These new tools make it easier to tell our own stories, and they give others the power to do the same.",
          "[J] The increase in the number of photographs and photographers might even be good for democracy itself. Hundreds of millions of potential citizen journalists make the world smaller and help keep leaders honest.",
          "[K] Who knows? Our obsession with documentation and constantly being connected could lead to a radical change in our way of being. Perhaps we are witnessing the development of a universal visual language. Of course, as with any language, there will be those who produce poetry and those who make shopping lists.",
          "[L] It's not clear whether this flowering of image-making will lead to a public that better appreciates and understands images. Or will it simply numb us to the profound effects a well-made image can have? Regardless, the change is irreversible. Let's hope the millions of new photographs made today help us see what we all have in common."

          "[A] I got my first real job at age 12, as a waitress. I am convinced that I learned more as a waitress than I ever did in a classroom. When I went on to college, it also paid for tuition and housing and - eventually - a camera. But best of all, being a waitress taught me to quickly assess and understand all kinds of people.",

          "[H] On many assignments, the most challenging part turned out to be the transportation. Over the years, I traveled by horse, car, train, truck, and all sorts of old vehicles. I traveled by mule in Mexico... by moped in Bermuda... In Africa I traveled by balloon...",
          "[I] Wherever I traveled in the world, taking beautiful pictures was always my goal. However, later in my career, I also wanted my pictures to make a real difference in people's lives.",

          "[C] As a place to live, the ocean has a couple of peculiarities. Firstly, there is almost nowhere to hide, so being invisible is very important. Secondly, as you descend, sunlight disappears. At 200 meters below the surface, the ocean becomes a kind of perpetual twilight, and at 600 meters the blue fades out too.",

          "[E] Other sea species use light to survive in the upper layers - but how? Some, such as certain shrimp and squid, illuminate their bellies to match the light coming from above. This allows them to become invisible to predators below.",
          "[F] But if the aim is to remain invisible, why do some creatures light up when they are touched? First, a sudden burst of light may startle a predator, giving the prey a chance to escape.",
          "[G] Second, there is the principle of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.' Giving off light can help summon the predator of your predator. Known as the 'burglar alarm' effect, this is especially useful for tiny life forms."

        paragraphs: [
          "[A] The everyday activity of eating involves more risk than you might think. It is estimated that each year in the United States, 48 million people suffer from foodborne diseases; 128,000 of them are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. In the developing world, contaminated food and water kill over half a million children a year. In most cases, virulent types of bacteria are to blame.",
          "[B] Bacteria are an integral part of a healthy life. There are 200 times as many bacteria in the intestines of a single human as there are human beings who have ever lived. Most of these bacteria help with digestion, making vitamins, shaping the immune system, and keeping us healthy. Nearly all raw food has bacteria in it as well. But the bacteria that produce foodborne illnesses are of a different, more dangerous kind.",
          "[C] Many of the bacteria that produce foodborne illnesses are present in the intestines of the animals we raise for food. When a food animal containing dangerous bacteria is cut open during processing, bacteria inside can contaminate the meat. Fruits and vegetables can pick up dangerous bacteria if washed or watered with contaminated water. A single bacterium, given the right conditions, divides rapidly enough to produce billions over the course of a day. This means that even only lightly contaminated food can be dangerous. Bacteria can also hide and multiply on dishtowels, cutting boards, sinks, knives, and kitchen counters, where they're easily transferred to food or hands.",
          "[D] Changes in the way in which farm animals are raised also affect the rate at which dangerous bacteria can spread. In the name of efficiency and economy, fish, cattle, and chickens are raised in giant 'factory' farms, which confine large numbers of animals in tight spaces. Cattle, for example, are crowded together under such conditions that if only one animal is contaminated with the virulent bacteria E. coli O157:H7, it will likely spread to others.",
          "[E] Disease investigators, like Patricia Griffin, are working to find the sources of these outbreaks and prevent them in the future. Griffin, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, has worked in the foodborne-disease business for 15 years. Periodic E. coli outbreaks turned her attention to the public food safety threat that exists in restaurants and in the food production system. Food safety is no longer just a question of handling food properly in the domestic kitchen. 'Now,' Griffin says, 'we are more aware that the responsibility does not rest solely with the cook. We know that contamination often occurs early in the production process - at steps on the way from farm or field or fishing ground to market.'",
          "[F] Griffin's job is to look for trends in food-related illness through the analysis of outbreaks. Her team tries to identify both the food source of an outbreak and the contaminating bacteria. To link cases together, the scientists use a powerful tool called PulseNet, a national computer network of health laboratories that matches types of bacteria using DNA analysis. PulseNet allows scientists to associate an illness in California, say, with one in Texas, tying together what might otherwise appear as unrelated cases. Then it's the job of the investigators to determine what went wrong in the food's journey to the table. This helps them decide whether to recall a particular food or to change the process by which it's produced.",
          "[G] In January 2000, public health officials in the state of Virginia noted an unusual group of patients sick with food poisoning from salmonella. Using PulseNet, the CDC identified 79 patients in 13 states who were infected with the same type of salmonella bacteria. Fifteen had been hospitalized; two had died. What was the common factor? All had eaten mangoes during the previous November and December. The investigation led to a single large mango farm in Brazil, where it was discovered that mangoes were being washed in contaminated water containing a type of salmonella bacteria. Salmonella contamination is a widespread problem; salmonella cases involving contaminated chicken, melons, coconut, and cereals were reported in 2018.",
          "[H] The mango outbreak had a larger lesson: We no longer eat only food that is in season or that is grown locally. Instead, we demand our strawberries, peaches, mangoes, and lettuce year-round. As a result, we are depending more and more on imports. Eating food grown elsewhere in the world means depending on the soil, water, and sanitary conditions in those places, and on the way in which their workers farm, harvest, process, and transport the food.",
          "[I] There are a number of success stories that provide hope and show us how international food production need not mean increased risk of contamination. Costa Rica has made sanitary production of fruits and vegetables a nationwide priority. Fresh fruits and vegetables are packed carefully in sanitary conditions; frequent hand washing is compulsory; and proper toilets are provided for workers in the fields. Such changes have made Carmela Velazquez, a food scientist from the University of Costa Rica, optimistic about the future. 'The farmers we've trained,' she says, 'will become models for all our growers.'",
          "[J] In Sweden, too, progress has been made in reducing the number of foodborne disease at an early stage. Swedish chicken farmers have eliminated salmonella from their farms by thoroughly cleaning the area where their chickens are kept, and by using chicken feed that has been heated to rid it of dangerous bacteria. Consequently, the chickens that Swedes buy are now salmonella-free. These successes suggest that it is indeed feasible for companies and farms to produce safe and sanitary food, while still making a profit."

          "[A] One cloudless midsummer day, biologist Andrew Parker knelt in the baking red sand of an Australian desert and gently placed the right back leg of a thorny devil into a dish of water. The thorny devil - a small lizard that has learned to survive in the extreme heat of the Australian desert - has a secret that fascinated Parker. 'Look, look!' he exclaimed. 'Its back is completely drenched!' Sure enough, in less than a minute, water from the dish had traveled up the lizard's leg, across its skin, and into its mouth. It was, in essence, drinking through its foot. The thorny devil can also do this when standing on wet sand - a vital competitive advantage in the desert. Parker had come here to solve the riddle of how it does this, not from purely biological interest, but with a specific purpose in mind: to make a device to help people collect water in the desert.",
          "[B] Parker is a leading scientist in the field of biomimetics - applying designs from nature to solve problems in engineering, materials science, medicine, and other fields. His studies of the body coverings of butterflies and beetles have led to brighter screens for cell phones. He has even drawn inspiration from nature's past: While visiting a museum in Poland, he noticed a 45-million-year-old fly trapped in amber and observed how the shape of its eye's surface reduced light reflection. This shape is now being used in solar panels to make them more efficient.",
          "[C] As part of the next phase in his plan to create a water-collection device inspired by the lizard, Parker sent his observations to Michael Rubner and Robert Cohen, two colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Parker is full of enthusiasm about the many possibilities of biomimetics. Rubner and Cohen, on the other hand, are much more practical; they focus on the ideas that have a chance of being applied successfully. This combination of biological insight and engineering pragmatism is vital to success in biomimetics. And it has led to several promising technologies.",
          "[D] Though Rubner and Cohen are certainly impressed by biological structures, they consider nature just a starting point for innovation. Cohen says, 'The natural structure provides a clue to what is useful ... But maybe you can do it better.' They consider a biomimetics project a success only if it has the potential to make a useful tool for people. 'Looking at pretty structures in nature is not sufficient,' says Cohen. 'What I want to know is can we actually transform these structures into [something] with true utility in the real world?'",
          "[E] The work of Parker, Rubner, and Cohen is only one part of a growing global biomimetics movement. Scientists around the world are studying and trying to copy a wide variety of nature's design secrets.",
          "[F] Potentially, one of the most useful applications of biomimetics is the robot. Professor Ronald Fearing of the University of California is creating a tiny robot fly that can be used in surveillance or rescue operations.",
          "[G] At Stanford University in California, Mark Cutkosky is working on a robot gecko. Cutkosky studied the extremely small structures on the tiny lizard's feet that allow it to run up and down vertical walls. He applied what he learned to create Stickybot, a robot that can walk up and down smooth vertical surfaces.",
          "[H] Despite the promise of the field and the brilliant people who work in it, biomimetics has led to surprisingly few business successes. Perhaps only one product has become truly famous - Velcro. But the main reason biomimetics hasn't yet been a business success is that nature is incredibly complex.",

It ends about 200,000 years later with their seven billion descendants spread across the Earth.",

          "[A] It is mid-afternoon on the island of Bora Bora in French Polynesia. Thousands of cheering spectators crowd the shore to see the end of the Hawaiki Nui Va'a, a challenging 130-kilometer Polynesian canoe race that virtually stops the nation. 'This is our heritage,' says Manutea Owen, a former canoe champion and a hero on his home island of Huahine. 'Our people came from over the sea by canoe. Sometimes when I'm out there competing, I try to imagine what they must have endured and the adventures they had crossing those huge distances.'",
          "[B] Manutea Owen's ancestors colonized nearly every island in the South Pacific. This was a remarkable feat of human navigation - comparable with humans going to the moon. Only recently have scientists begun to understand where these amazing voyagers came from, and how - with simple canoes and no navigation equipment - they reached hundreds of islands scattered across an ocean that covers nearly a third of the globe.",
          "[C] From about 1300 to 800 B.C., the Lapita people colonized islands that stretch over millions of square kilometers, including the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia, and Samoa. Then, for unknown reasons, they stopped. There was an interval of around 1,000 years before the Polynesian civilization - descendants of the Lapita - launched a new period of exploration.",
          "[D] There is one stubborn question for which archeology has yet to provide any answers. How did the Lapita and early Polynesian pioneers accomplish a feat that is analogous to a moon landing? Little evidence remains to help us understand their remarkable sailing skills.",
          "[E] Sailors have always relied upon the so-called trade winds, winds that blow steadily and in predictable directions over the ocean's surface. Irwin notes that the Lapita's expansion into the Pacific was eastward, against steady trade winds. Sailing against the wind, he argues, may have been the key to their success.",
          "[F] Irwin hypothesizes that once out in the open ocean, the explorers would detect a variety of clues to follow to land. This included seabirds and turtles that need islands on which to build their nests, coconuts and twigs carried out to sea, and the clouds that tend to form over some islands in the afternoon.",
          "[G] These theories rely on one unproven point - that the Lapita and early Polynesians had mastered the skill of sailing against the wind using a technique called 'tacking.' Rather than give all the credit to their bravery and technique, Atholl Anderson thinks that they might also have been lucky - helped by El Niño.",
          "[H] El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean when the surface water temperature is unusually high. One of its effects is to cause trade winds in the South Pacific to weaken or to reverse direction and blow to the east. Scientists believe that El Niño phenomena were unusually frequent around the time of the Lapita expansion.",
          "[I] The success of the Lapita and their descendants may have due to their own sailing skills, to reverse trade winds, or to a mixture of both. But it is certain that by the time Europeans came to the Pacific, nearly every piece of land - hundreds of islands in all - had already been discovered by the Lapita and the Polynesians."

          "[A] About 9,500 years ago, ancient accountants in Sumer invented a way to keep track of farmers' crops and livestock. They began using small pieces of baked clay, almost like the tokens used in board games today. One piece might signify a measure of grain, while another with a different shape might represent a farm animal or a jar of olive oil.",
          "[B] Those little ceramic shapes might not seem to have much in common with today's $100 bill - or with the credit cards and online transactions that are rapidly taking the place of cash - but the roots of our modern methods of payment lie in those Sumerian tokens. Such early accounting tools evolved into a system of finance and into money itself.",
          "[C] Since ancient times, humans have used items to represent value - from stones to animal skins, to whale teeth. In the ancient world, people often relied upon symbols that had tangible value in their own right. The ancient Chinese made payments with cowrie shells, which were prized for their beauty as materials for jewelry.",
          "[D] But eventually there arose a new, universal currency: gold. The gleaming metal could be combined with other metals at high temperatures to create alloys, and was easy to melt and hammer into shapes. It became the raw material for the first coins, created in Lydia around 2,700 years ago.",
          "[E] The result, explains financial author Kabir Sehgal, was an economic system in which 'you knew the value of what you had, and what you could buy with it.' Unlike modern money, ancient coins were what economists call fullbodied or commodity money: Their value was fixed by the metal in them.",
          "[F] Money's convenience made it easier for ancient merchants to develop large-scale trade networks, in which spices and grain could be bought and sold across distances of thousands of kilometers. This led to the first foreign exchanges.",
          "[G] In the centuries that followed, trade routes forged more cultural connections between nations and regions. Besides exchanging money and goods, traders also spread religious beliefs, knowledge, and new inventions, creating connections among far-flung cultures.",
          "[H] The dangers of moving money and goods over distances led humans to develop increasingly complex economic organizations. In the 1600s, investors gathering in London coffeehouses began to underwrite traders and colonists heading to the New World.",
          "[I] By the 1700s, the global economy had grown so much that it was inconvenient to transport and store large quantities of coins. Several societies therefore shifted toward paper currency. The earliest paper bills were literally receipts that gave the bearer ownership of gold or silver coins.",
          "[J] But as Lloyd Thomas explains, bankers eventually realized that many people simply used their notes rather than redeeming them for gold. That revelation eventually led to the concept of fiat money, which governments issue today. Today's money has value essentially because a government says that it does.",
          "[K] It's a system with an important advantage, in that human judgment determines the amount of money in circulation. On the other hand, this can become a disadvantage. If a government decides to issue too much money, it can trigger an inflationary spiral that raises the price of goods and services.",
          "[L] By the 20th century, new methods of payment had begun to emerge as alternatives to cash. In the 1920s, oil companies and hotel chains began to issue credit cards. In 1950, Diners Club International issued the first universal credit card.",
          "[M] In 2009, yet another high-tech successor to money emerged: Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a sort of unofficial virtual Internet currency. They aren't issued or even controlled by governments, and they exist only in the cloud or on a person's computer.",
          "[N] From the clay tokens of Sumer to today's virtual currencies, the evolution of money has helped drive the development of civilization. Money makes it easier not only to buy and sell goods, but also to connect with the world."

          "[A] According to the European Banking Authority, a virtual currency is 'a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is accepted as a means of payment and can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically.' There are many types of virtual currency, but the best known is probably Bitcoin.",
          "[B] In online articles, or in newspapers or magazines, you may have seen pictures of gold or silver coins marked with the Bitcoin symbol. However - since Bitcoins exist only as digital constructs - these are merely representations. Bitcoin is a type of digital money known as a 'cryptocurrency'.",
          "[C] Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank or by a government agency. And unlike credit cards, the Bitcoin network is not run by a company. It is operated by a global network of computers called a blockchain network, which records every Bitcoin transaction in the world.",
          "[D] The first reference to Bitcoin appeared in 2008, in a paper by a writer supposedly named Satoshi Nakamoto. However, the name turned out to be a pseudonym for a person or group who preferred to remain anonymous. A year later, Bitcoin was released as open-source software.",
          "[E] Bitcoin was not the first attempt at a cryptocurrency; others had existed in one form or another for nearly 50 years, but without much success. In a short space of time, though, Bitcoin became the first cryptocurrency to be widely traded internationally.",
          "[F] In its early days, Bitcoin was known for its link with illegal drugs, such as those bought and sold on Silk Road, an online black market set up in 2011. Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in 2013. According to some experts, the shutdown gave Bitcoin a chance to gain some much-needed legitimacy.",
          "[G] Each Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places. That means you can send someone a minimum of 0.00000001 Bitcoins. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin - the penny of the Bitcoin world - is called a 'Satoshi.'",
          "[H] Like gold or other precious metals used as money, Bitcoins are scarce. But their scarcity is not natural or accidental. New Bitcoins are added only by being 'mined.' Computer users on the blockchain network race to solve increasingly complicated mathematical problems.",
          "[I] A useful analogy: Think of the blockchain network as an engine. Engines can be used to power all types of vehicles: cars, boats, aircraft. Bitcoin is a vehicle that uses that engine. Because it was the first major virtual currency to use blockchain, you could think of Bitcoin as an early model vehicle, like a Model T Ford.",
          "[J] In most cases, financial transactions involve exchange fees, taxes, and payment delays to guard against fraud. Virtual transactions, however, are speedy and cheap - and are settled immediately.",
          "[K] Virtual currencies also make it possible to make a digital payment without needing PayPal or a credit card. This is particularly useful in many parts of Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Immigrants to developed countries may find it a convenient way to send funds back home to their families.",
          "[L] Bitcoin supporter Jonathan Mohan says, 'The vast majority of people on the planet don't even own a bank account … In these developing nations, you're not going to see them start getting bank accounts. You're going to see them just going straight to Bitcoins.'",
          "[M] The most obvious drawback is a lack of stability in the value of the currency. Bitcoin's independence makes it more stable in principle than traditional currencies. In reality, though, its value has fluctuated wildly over the time it has been in existence.",
          "[N] So it is worth thinking twice before putting all or a substantial amount of your assets into a virtual currency like Bitcoin. The rule of investing in virtual currency is the same as investing in stocks: Never invest more than you can afford to lose."

Some splash in the water, some drop flowers into it, and others light oil lamps and set them floating on the river. There are men who splash into the water theatrically with swords in hand. There are unwilling children whose parents drag them in fully clothed. There are holy men dressed in bright orange robes with skin covered in sacred white ash. There are other devout men wearing the ash but little or no clothing, as their religion requires. There are people everywhere, but somehow, incredibly, no one is stepped on, no one is drowned, and no one is heard screaming for help. All is harmony.",
          "[C] It is the Kumbh Mela, the largest and most sacred gathering of all Hindu pilgrimages. It is also considered to be the largest peaceful gathering of people anywhere in the world. Each year, as part of the Kumbh, several million Hindus bathe here in the sacred Ganges River. Every 12 years, the gathering becomes much larger, and a giant tent city is set up to house the participants.",
          "[D] In 2013, the Kumbh lasted 55 days, and it is estimated that 120 million pilgrims participated in activities such as ritual bathing, praying, singing, feeding the poor, and religious discussion. The Kumbh tent city covered more than 25 square kilometers. It was divided into 14 areas, each with its own hospital, police station, roads, grocery store, and supplies of electricity and drinking water - an extraordinary achievement. The basic crowd-control strategy was to avoid dangerous overcrowding at 'hot spots,' such as bridges and train stations. 'Incredibly well organized, incredibly clean, very efficiently run,' said Rahul Mehrotra, a professor of urban design and planning at Harvard University, who observed the festival.",
          "[E] Psychologists like Stephen Reicher from the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. suspect that crowds have a positive impact on the health of the individuals within them. 'What our research shows is that, actually, crowds are critical to society,' he says. 'They help form our sense of who we are, they help form our relations to others - they even help determine our physical well-being.'",
          "[F] Reicher and his colleagues came to this, the largest Hindu festival, to test the idea that crowds are beneficial and to confirm the healthful effects of the Kumbh on its participants. Before the start of the 2011 festival, his researchers went out into the Indian countryside to question a group of prospective pilgrims about their mental and physical health. They also questioned people who didn't plan to attend. The researchers returned to question both groups a month after the Kumbh had ended. Those who stayed in their villages reported no real change over the period of the study. The pilgrims, on the other hand, reported a 10 percent improvement in their health, including less pain, less anxiety, and higher energy levels. What's more, the good effects lasted long afterward.",
          "[G] Why should belonging to a crowd improve your health? Psychologists think a shared identity is the cause. 'You think in terms of 'we' rather than 'I,'' explains Nick Hopkins from the University of Dundee in the U.K. This way of thinking alters human relationships. Members of the crowd support one another, competition becomes cooperation, and people are able to achieve their goals in a way they wouldn't be able to alone.",
          "[H] Unfortunately - in spite of the mutual support so evident elsewhere at the Kumbh - 36 people died in a stampede at the Allahabad train station on February 10, 2013. Somehow the crowd had lost its harmony. Reicher wrote that one possible cause was that the pilgrims no longer formed a psychological crowd. They no longer saw those around them as fellow pilgrims, but rather as competitors for seats on a train.",
          "[I] Strangely, before this unfortunate incident, Reicher had interviewed a pilgrim who was asked to describe the feeling in the crowd at the station. 'People think they are more powerful than you. They can push you around,' she said. She was then asked to describe the feeling at the Kumbh: 'People are concerned about you. They treat you in a polite manner.' The stampede was an example of what can happen when the psychological cooperation of a crowd breaks down.",
          "[J] Incidents such as the stampede are rare at the Kumbh, and this one is unlikely to deter pilgrims from attending the event in the future. The police will undoubtedly learn from this experience and make the station safer. But in crowds as large as those at the Kumbh, individuals must put their faith in the power of 'psychological cooperation,' as Stephen Reicher calls it. In other words, 'Love thy neighbor.'"

          "[A] In recent years, the Internet has become a particularly volatile place. Aggression on social media is now commonplace. In a 2017 study of 4,000 people by the Pew Research Center, four out of ten said they'd experienced harassment online. More than half of the victims said they did not know the identity of the perpetrator. Most people agreed that the anonymity of the Internet provides cover for nasty and harassing behavior.",
          "[B] Does this growing aggression on social media give us a glimpse of our real human nature? Are we - at our core - belligerent beasts? It's true that hate crimes are on the rise, and political divisions appear to be growing. The level of public bitterness - especially online - is substantial. But I don't believe that's because social media has unlocked our cruel human nature.",
          "[C] As an evolutionary anthropologist, I have spent years researching and writing about our transformation as a species. Over the past two million years, we have evolved from groups of apelike beings armed with sticks and stones to the creators of cars, rockets, great works of art, nations, and global economic systems.",
          "[D] How did we do this? Our brains got bigger, and our capacity for cooperation exploded. We are wired to collaborate, to create diverse social relationships, and to solve problems together. This is the inheritance that everyone in the 21st century carries.",
          "[E] I would argue that the rise in online aggression is a product of our evolutionary social skills, the social media boom, and the specific political and economic context in which we find ourselves. This explosive combination has opened up a space for more and more people to fan the flames of aggression and insult online.",
          "[F] We've all heard the expression 'you are what you eat.' But when it comes to our behavior, a more appropriate expression may be 'you are whom you meet.' How we perceive, experience, and act in the world is shaped by who and what surround us on a daily basis. This includes our families, communities, institutions, beliefs, and role models.",
          "[G] These sources of influence affect our neurobiology in subtle ways. How we perceive the world is related to the patterns of people and places that we see as most connected to us. This process has deep evolutionary roots and gives humans what we call a shared reality. The connection between minds and experiences enables us to share space and work together effectively - more so than most other beings.",
          "[H] But the 'whom' in the expression 'whom we meet' has been changing. We may receive more information now from online sources than from physical social experiences. We may hear more announcements from 24-hour news outlets than from conversations with other humans. The ways we socially interact, especially on social media, are increasing at a time when we are more and more divided, both socially and economically. What may be the results of this?",
          "[I] Historically, we have maintained harmony by displaying compassion and friendship, and by developing connectedness when we get together. On social media, the anonymity and lack of face-to-face interaction remove a crucial part of the equation of human sociality. This opens the door to more frequent, and severe, displays of aggression. Aggressive behavior - especially to those you don't have to confront face-to-face - is easier than it's ever been. And for the aggressor, there are often no consequences.",
          "[J] Humans are evolutionarily successful because our big brains have allowed us to bond and cooperate in more complex ways than any other animal. The capacity to observe how the world operates, to imagine how it might improve, and to turn that vision into reality is a key aspect of our humanity. And there lies the solution to the problem. We are equipped with the skill set to calm aggression, and to encourage cohesion.",
          "[K] For thousands of years, people have acted collectively to punish and shame aggressive antisocial actions such as bullying or abuse. On social media - where the aggressor is remote and anonymous - even the best-intentioned individual challenge may turn into a shouting match. But confronting the bully with a group action - a reasoned, communal response rather than a solo gesture - can be more effective at shutting down aggression. Look at the public pressures placed on media corporations to monitor hate speech and fake news online, for instance. These are examples of how humans can collaborate to encourage what's positive and discourage what's negative.",
          "[L] Yes, it seems that the world is getting more aggressive, but that's not because we are more aggressive at our core. It's because we haven't been stepping up together to do the difficult social work our contemporary world demands. That means standing up against bullying, abuse, and aggressive harassment, and promoting pro-social attitudes and actions. In person and on social media, we must do both."

          "[A] It's a story as compelling as any murder mystery. It begins in 1821 on the remote British island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. This is where Napoleon Bonaparte - one-time emperor of France - is held prisoner after losing his final battle at Waterloo in 1815. In February 1821, Napoleon's health reportedly begins to fail, and he dies three months later at the age of 51. An autopsy performed the next morning reveals a stomach ulcer, possibly cancerous.",
          "[B] The real cause of death, however, has been in dispute ever since. Historians, toxicologists, doctors, and other experts - as well as amateur investigators - have considered the question of how and why Napoleon died. Many are convinced that he was actually murdered. So far, though, the experts have not been able to reach an agreement.",
          "[C] Ben Weider, founder of the International Napoleonic Society, believes that Napoleon was poisoned with arsenic, a deadly chemical. Weider has relentlessly sought the cause of Napoleon's death for more than four decades and has put considerable resources into solving the mystery. In his view, Napoleon was poisoned by the British and by French royalists, who wanted him out of the way once and for all. Weider offers as the central point of his hypothesis the hair analysis done by Pascal Kintz, a French toxicologist at the Legal Medicine Institute of Strasbourg. Kintz analyzed Napoleon's hair and confirmed that it contained arsenic. While Kintz can't say exactly how or why the arsenic was there, Weider is convinced that 'the poisoning of Napoleon was planned and deliberate.'",
          "[D] David Jones, an immunologist at the University of Newcastle in England, has studied the walls at Longwood House, the building on St. Helena where Napoleon lived his last years. He found that the wallpaper was painted with a substance containing arsenic. According to Jones, conditions on the hot and humid island caused the arsenic to be released into the air.",
          "[E] Then again, paint may not have been the only source of arsenic on St. Helena. Some toxicologists say that it is not uncommon for people who eat large amounts of seafood to have an unusually high level of arsenic in their blood. Because St. Helena is a small island 2,000 kilometers from the nearest mainland, it is likely that a large part of Napoleon's diet consisted of seafood. Additionally, the doctors who examined Napoleon's body after his death didn't find any of the usual symptoms associated with arsenic poisoning, such as bleeding inside the heart.",
          "[F] Steven Karch, an American heart disease expert, believes that Napoleon was killed by his own doctors. They gave him large doses of dangerous chemicals commonly used as medicine at the time. According to Karch's theory, the day before Napoleon's death, he was given a massive amount of mercurous chloride - a chemical once given to patients with heart disease. That and other medications, Karch theorizes, disrupted Napoleon's heartbeat and ultimately caused his heart to cease beating. While Karch admits that arsenic exposure was a partial cause, he believes it was the doctors' errors that actually caused the heart attack.",
          "[G] Historian Jean Tulard believes that cancer and ulcers, as reported by doctors who examined the body, were the cause of Napoleon's death. Tulard remains unconvinced by Kintz's hair analysis. In his estimation, the hair that was tested may not even have been Napoleon's. Tulard also discounts the poisoning theory on the grounds that no one has yet found anything linking the British or the French royalists - or anyone else for that matter - to a plot against Napoleon's life. Still, doubts remain that cancer was one of the main causes. One cancer specialist believes that Napoleon probably didn't have advanced stomach cancer because people with that disease always lose a lot of weight. According to reports, Napoleon never lost any weight during his stay on St. Helena. In fact, he gained a fair amount.",
          "[H] 'One of my ancestors did it,' says François de Candé-Montholon. 'I'm an aristocrat. Aristocrats don't like revolution, and Napoleon made revolutions.' Candé-Montholon's great-great-great-great-grandfather - the Count of Montholon - was stationed with Napoleon on St. Helena. Napoleon had a love affair with the count's wife, and there were rumors that Napoleon was in fact the father of her youngest child. The count, it is observed, had control of Napoleon's wine cellar and food. Could he, motivated by revenge, have poisoned the wine?",
          "[I] 'Everyone is right, and no one is right,' says Paul Fornes of the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris. Fornes has reviewed the 1821 autopsy report and other historical records and concludes: 'Napoleon may have died with cancer, but he didn't die of cancer.' Likewise, he says that although the hair analysis indicates the presence of arsenic, no one can say if he was intentionally given the arsenic, or if it was what ultimately killed him. In Fornes's opinion, evidence for murder by poisoning is inconclusive and wouldn't hold up in a court of law.",
          "[J] Napoleon Bonaparte's body was returned to France in 1840, and it has rested in a grand tomb in Paris ever since. Some think it is time to open the tomb and to examine the remains using modern methods. French historian and doctor Jean-François Lemaire, however, believes that serious science and history have little to do with it anymore: 'We are now in the world of entertainment,' he says. It seems unlikely that new facts will settle the issue - people just enjoy the mystery too much."

          "[A] Marcella Fierro has been a professor in the Department of Legal Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) School of Medicine since 1973. She is also the former chief medical examiner of the Commonwealth of Virginia. She oversaw the forensic investigation of violent, suspicious, and unnatural deaths in Virginia, and she inspired the character Kay Scarpetta in Patricia Cornwell's best-selling crime novels. Alphonse Poklis served in the Department of Pathology at VCU for almost 30 years. As director of its toxicology laboratory, he worked with Fierro to analyze medical evidence in homicide cases, and often testified as an expert in court.",
          "[B] At what point do you get called in [to investigate a death]? Marcella Fierro: We see any death that is sudden, unexpected, violent, or where there is an allegation of foul play. If we have the body before it's in the ground, we deal with it. But often it takes time for an allegation to be made or for someone to believe it. Perhaps a family member has a motive: There's dissension about property, inheritance, a new wife, a child not getting a fair share. Those things set a chain of events into motion. The body has to be exhumed.",
          "[C] Then what? How do you proceed? MF: I take umpteen tissue samples at autopsy: heart, liver, lungs, brain, spleen, hair, nails. Blood tells you what was going on in the body at the time of death. [The tissue in] the eye is great. It's clean. No fermentation or contamination from bacteria. Al and I work together. What poisons are candidates? What's best to collect? You have to have a strategy. We'd want to know what poison the defendant would have access to. If it's a farmer, we look for agricultural things like pesticides or herbicides. We need to have an idea of where we are going. We can easily run out of tissue and blood samples before we run out of tests to do.",
          "[D] So, the technology you use to detect poisons in a corpse must be pretty sophisticated? Alphonse Poklis: Very. I call it the vanishing zero. In the 1960s, it took 25 milliliters of blood to detect morphine. Today, we can use one milliliter to do the same work. In terms of sensitivity, we've gone from micrograms to nanograms, which is parts per billion, to parts per trillion with mass spectrometry. You can find anything if you do the research. Of course, some substances are more apparent. You can smell cyanide the minute you open a body at autopsy. Cyanide works fast - like in movies where the captured spy bites on the capsule and dies … [E]very cell is deprived of oxygen. You die quickly, dramatically, violently.",
          "[E] Is there a personality profile specific to poisoners? AP: The poisoner tries to cover up what he or she does. Poison is the weapon of controlling, sneaky people with no conscience, no sorrow, no remorse. They are scary, manipulative; if you weren't convinced by the evidence, you wouldn't believe they could do such a thing.",

The doctors were twisting themselves inside out to figure it out. He'd get better; his wife would come in to see him in the hospital and bring him banana pudding. Someone finally ordered a [toxicity test] on him, but he was discharged before the results came back: off the charts for arsenic. By the time someone saw the labs, it was too late. We called the wife Banana Pudding Lily.",
          "[G] How many cases of suspected homicidal poisonings do you evaluate in the course of a year? AP: Frankly, relatively few … If you are going to kill someone [it's more likely] you shoot them … In [American] culture everything is solved in 30 minutes, so you aren't going to plan, go someplace to get poison, and figure out 'how am I going to give it?'",

          "[A] After the long, dusty drive from the city, the first surprises that visitors encounter are the shade trees and the beautiful green lawn. Then they notice the birds and monkeys swooping in and out of the trees. After passing through the entrance gate, a long stone pathway leads to a place where the ground begins to open up. There, on the far side of the grass, is what seems to be a magnificent temple built in a huge hole in the ground. However, it is not a temple, but a well. This is Rani ki Vav - the Queen's Stepwell.",
          "[B] The weather is dry most of the year in northwestern India. Then, during the summer, rain arrives suddenly and seeps down through the sandy soil. Centuries ago, people dug holes to get at the water, and then built stone stairways down where the water collected. These stepwells were simple at first, but some later became architectural works of art. Rani ki Vav is among the most magnificent.",
          "[C] Located near the Saraswati River in Gujarat, Rani ki Vav was built late in the 11th century by Queen Udayamati as a memorial to her dead king. It was rarely used, and by 1300, seasonal floods had filled it with sand. Not until the 1960s did Indian archeologists begin digging it out. Witnesses were stunned by what was hidden beneath all that sand.",
          "[D] 'We've seen photographs, but nothing compares with seeing it firsthand,' says Lyn Wilson, an archeological scientist from Glasgow. With the latest in digital scanning technology, she and her colleagues from the Centre for Digital Documentation and Visualisation aim to reduce the chances that Rani ki Vav - or at least the data describing it - will ever be lost again.",
          "[E] Of all the projects they have undertaken - from the Standing Stones of Stenness to Mount Rushmore - this is among the most difficult. By 12:30 p.m., their equipment arrives. As team members open the boxes, they meet their first challenge: two buses full of Indian schoolboys on a class trip. They crowd around Wilson as though she's a Bollywood star. A guard gently directs them to move back with a long stick.",
          "[F] For the next two weeks, the team will have to fight the heat and cope with curious crowds while they aim laser beams at every surface of the stepwell in order to record the entire structure digitally. Should Rani ki Vav be lost again - through floods, war, earthquakes, or just the passage of time - there will be a precise 3-D copy available on the Internet.",
          "[G] A tour of the well reveals some of the extremely complex carvings the team must record. On a lower level, seven sculptures of the four-armed god Vishnu decorate the walls. Lord Kalki sits tall on a horse, one foot about to crush an enemy's head. Then there's Varaha, a god with the head of a boar. A tiny goddess standing on his shoulder lovingly rubs his nose. 'It reminds me of the wonderful Hollywood movie King Kong,' remarks K. C. Nauriyal, an Indian archeologist working at the site.",
          "[H] Also immortalized in stone are the Hindu gods Brahma and Shiva. Scattered among the gods slither snakes and creatures called Naga Kanya that are half-snake, half-woman. There are also apsaras - female spirits of the clouds and water - putting on lipstick or earrings, gazing at mirrors, or drying their hair. One of them playfully strikes a monkey as it pulls down her garment. Another pulls on the beard of an admiring beggar. 'The spice of life,' Nauriyal calls them. But one wrong blow with a hammer and their beauty would be destroyed forever.",
          "[I] A stairway leads to the lowest levels, and a dark passage into the well itself. Near the bottom of the well are two statues of the god Vishnu. One is sleeping on the back of a large snake, and the other is sitting straight up. There was a belief that if there were two statues of Lord Vishnu in this form, the water would never dry up - but it did. Agricultural development and a warmer climate are two likely causes. And, like the water, the sculptures may one day disappear, surviving perhaps only as a virtual model online.",
          "[J] Inside a tent at the edge of the stepwell, archeologist Justin Barton assembles the first pieces of the 3-D digital image of Rani ki Vav. Weirdly colored columns and lintels appear on the screen. The colors - greenish in the brightest areas, grading to oranges and yellows - indicate reflectivity, or how readily the laser comes bouncing back. Barton grabs the images with the cursor, swinging them around like a child's building blocks, fitting each into the larger model of Rani ki Vav.",
          "[K] Back in Glasgow, the digital copy will be completed, ultimately joining more than a hundred others already in a computer database. But that's barely the beginning. 'So much heritage is being lost on a daily basis,' says Barton, 'through war and human aggression, environmental changes, and the wear and tear of time.' Barton and his colleagues are in a race to digitally preserve for future generations as many of the world's threatened archeological treasures as they can - before they disappear forever."

          "[Intro] El Dorado. Atlantis. The Lost City of Z. Tales of fabled places have drawn generations of explorers to the most remote locations on Earth. Usually they return empty-handed - if they return at all. But sometimes the pursuit of myth can lead to real discoveries.",
          "[A] On February 18, 2015, a helicopter carrying a team of explorers headed toward the mountains of La Mosquitia, a remote area of Honduras. Below, farms gradually gave way to steep slopes, some covered with unbroken rain forest. The pilot headed for a V-shaped gap in a distant ridge. Beyond it lay a valley surrounded by mountains: a landscape of emerald and gold. There were no signs of human life - not a road, a trail, or a column of smoke. The pilot descended, aiming for a clearing along a riverbank.",
          "[B] The team had come to explore a region long thought to contain 'Ciudad Blanca' - a city built of white stone, known as the Lost City of the Monkey God. One of the team members was an archeologist named Chris Fisher. Fisher didn't believe in the legend, but he did believe that the valley - known simply as T1 - contained a secret. In fact, somewhere in this valley, he believed, were the ruins of a real lost city, abandoned for at least half a millennium.",
          "[C] The Mosquitia region of Honduras and Nicaragua contains vast areas of dense vegetation, swamps, and rivers. It also hides a number of dangers: deadly snakes, hungry jaguars, and insects carrying potentially deadly diseases.",
          "[D] Over time, the myth of La Mosquitia's White City became part of the Honduran national consciousness. By the 1930s, it had also captured the imagination of the American public. Several expeditions were launched to find it, including three by the Museum of the American Indian in New York City. The first two came back with rumors of a lost city containing a giant statue of a monkey god.",
          "[E] The museum's third expedition, a group led by a journalist named Theodore Morde, landed in Honduras in early 1940. Morde emerged from the jungle five months later with boxes of artifacts, claiming he had found evidence of an ancient walled city. He would not reveal the location for fear of looting, but promised to return the following year. He never did; he died in 1954. The city - if there was one - remained unidentified.",
          "[F] In the 1990s, a documentary filmmaker named Steve Elkins became fascinated by the legend of the White City. He spent years studying reports from explorers, archeologists, and geologists. He then studied satellite photographs of three valleys, which he labeled T1, T2, and T3 (T stands for 'target'). The images, however, were inconclusive, and he realized he needed a better way to see through the dense jungle canopy.",
          "[G] Then, in 2010, Elkins learned of a new technology called lidar (light detection and ranging) - a way to explore the valleys from aircraft flying above the jungle. Lidar works by bouncing hundreds of thousands of pulses of infrared laser beams off the ground below. Scanning the three valleys cost a quarter of a million dollars, but the initial results were astonishing. In an attempt to investigate the myth of the White City, Elkins had apparently uncovered two real ancient cities in valleys T1 and T3. To help interpret the data, he turned to Chris Fisher, a specialist on Mesoamerica.",
          "[H] This is how, in February 2015, Fisher and his team came to be in the dense jungle of La Mosquitia. Besides Fisher, who had extensive experience with lidar imagery, the team included two other archeologists, a group of scientists, and Elkins's camera crew.",
          "[I] The team set out from base camp, cutting a trail through the jungle with machetes. They faced plenty of challenges - snakes, insects, mud, and constant rain. Although the area was remote, they were not alone. Animals wandered around them or gathered in the trees above, seemingly unafraid. 'I've never seen anything like it,' one team member noted. 'I don't think these animals have ever seen human beings.'",
          "[J] After climbing above the floodplain, they arrived at the base of a steep, jungle-covered highland - the edge of the presumed city. 'Let's go to the top,' Fisher said. Holding onto vines and tree roots, the explorers continued up the muddy slope. At the summit, Fisher pointed out the outline of a building. There was evidence of construction - probably an earthen pyramid. The team later identified one of the city's plazas, or large public spaces - an area of rain forest as level as a soccer field. Straight-edged mounds on three sides revealed the remains of walls and buildings.",
          "[K] By the following afternoon, the group had mapped three more plazas and many mounds. But it appeared that the river was rising, so they prepared to leave. Suddenly, one of the cameramen called out: 'Hey, there are some weird stones over here.'",
          "[L] At the base of the pyramid, the team found the tops of dozens of beautifully carved stone sculptures: the head of a jaguar, large jars carved with snakes, and objects that looked like seats or tables. All the artifacts were in perfect condition, apparently untouched since they had been left centuries before. There were 52 objects above ground - and probably many more below the surface.",
          "[M] In the days that followed, the team recorded each object using a 3-D scanner. Nothing was touched, nothing removed. Further expeditions to the area are now being planned with the support of the Honduran government. There is still much to learn about the former inhabitants of La Mosquitia. Whether or not the White City is real or myth, the search for it has led to riches."

          "[A] In 1995, Valter Longo, a cell biologist at the University of Southern California who studies aging, began to change the genes of simple organisms like single-celled yeast, creating mutations that allowed them to live longer. The reasons for this varied. Some mutated cells could repair their DNA more effectively than normal cells; others became better able to stop the type of DNA damage that would promote cancer in humans.",
          "[B] Others were studying the same processes. In 1996, Andrzej Bartke, a scientist at Southern Illinois University, began messing around with mouse genes that are involved with growth. He showed - not surprisingly - that owing to the fact that the growth hormone pathway had been shut down, the mice were smaller. What was surprising was that they had longer lifespans - about 40 percent longer - than normal mice. Could similar processes be at work in humans? Could genetic mutations protect against diseases of age?",

In a series of studies over the past several years Holtzer and Joe Verghese have shown that the amount of thinking people are able do while they walk and talk predicts the risk of dementia, loss of mobility, and falls.",
          "[F] These experiments add to research at Einstein led by Nir Barzilai, an Israeli doctor who in 1998 began a study of three New York centenarians. The Einstein project has since grown to include more than 500 centenarians in and around New York City - all from central Europe and all Ashkenazi Jews, a historically isolated population. In this homogeneous group, research has again revealed a set of genes related to longevity.",
          "[G] As they gathered more and more data, the Einstein researchers noticed that the Ashkenazi centenarians had exceptionally high levels of HDL, often called the good form of cholesterol, and that the children of these centenarians had even higher levels. This sent them off to analyze the DNA of about a hundred genes known to be involved in breaking down and using of cholesterol. What they found was a variant of a gene known as CETP that was more common in centenarians than in others. When they investigated the centenarian version of the CETP gene, they confirmed earlier research showing that due to this particular gene variant, people were protected against heart disease. They have gone on to show that since people have this gene, they perform better on mental tasks like the 'walking while talking' experiments.",
          "[H] Einstein's large and ambitious longevity program is part of a sea change sweeping human genetics research, where the emphasis for the past 20 years has been on the search for so-called disease genes - genes that are linked to certain chronic health problems. Many researchers are now focused largely on the search for protective genes, which seem to keep people from getting disease or from aging.",
          "[I] The race to find the keys to longevity has even led scientists to a place that looks increasingly important in setting every individual's rate of aging: the womb. Researchers at Einstein now suspect that our pattern of aging may be set very early, perhaps before we're born. To study this hypothesis, Francine Einstein and John Greally have been examining subtle chemical markings on the DNA recovered from the blood of babies born in the Bronx and comparing differences in babies who were small, normal, or large. They have found that the pattern of DNA markings in both small and large babies is significantly different from that of normal-size babies. As Barzilai explains it, because of things that influence us before we are even born, our rate of aging may be affected. The fetus, in other words, may be father of the old man."

'Goochi, goochi, goo,' Tonino whispers. For this strong, healthy, 1.8-meter-tall man, these two things - hard work and family - form the foundation of his life. They may also help explain why Tonino and his neighbors live so long.",
          "[C] A community of 2,400 people, Silanus is located on the edge of a mountainous region in central Sardinia, where dry fields rise suddenly into mountains of stone. In a group of villages in the heart of the region, 91 of the 17,865 people born between 1880 and 1900 have lived to their hundredth birthday - a rate more than twice as high as the average for Italy.",
          "[D] Why do they live so long? Lifestyle is part of the answer. By 11:00 a.m. on this particular day, the industrious Tonino has already milked four cows, chopped wood, slaughtered a calf, and walked over six kilometers with his sheep. Now, taking the day's first break, he gathers his grown children, grandson, and visitors around the kitchen table. Giovanna, his wife, unties a handkerchief containing a paper-thin flatbread called carta da musica, pours some red wine, and cuts slices of homemade pecorino cheese.",
          "[E] These Sardinians also benefit from their genetic history. According to Paolo Francalacci of the University of Sassari, 80 percent of them are directly related to the first Sardinians, who arrived in the area 11,000 years ago. Genetic traits made stronger over generations may favor longevity. Nutrition, too, is a factor. The Sardinians' diet is loaded with fruits and vegetables, milk and milk products, fish, and wine. Most of these items are homegrown.",
          "[F] It's Friday morning, and Marge Jetton is speeding down the highway in her purple Cadillac. She wears dark sunglasses to protect her eyes from the sun's glare, though her head is barely higher than the steering wheel. Marge, who turned 101 in September, is late for one of several volunteer commitments she has today. Already this morning she's eaten breakfast, walked one and a half kilometers, and lifted weights. 'I don't know why God gave me the privilege of living so long,' she says, pointing to herself. 'But look what he did.'",
          "[G] Marge - like many other residents of Loma Linda, California - is a Seventh-Day Adventist. The Adventist Church has always practiced and been a proponent of healthy living. It forbids smoking, alcohol consumption, and certain foods, such as pork. The church also discourages the consumption of other meat, rich foods, caffeinated drinks, and most spices. Adventists also observe a sacred day of the week on Saturday, assembling and socializing with other church members, which helps to relieve stress.",
          "[H] A study found that the Adventists' habit of consuming beans, soymilk, tomatoes, and fruit lowered their risk of developing certain cancers. It also suggested that eating whole wheat bread, drinking five glasses of water a day, and consuming four servings of nuts a week reduced their risk of heart disease. It found that not eating red meat had been helpful in avoiding both cancer and heart disease.",
          "[I] In the end, the study reached a surprising conclusion, says Gary Fraser of Loma Linda University: The average Adventist's lifespan surpasses that of the average Californian by four to ten years. That compelling evidence makes the Adventists one of the most-studied cultures of longevity in the United States.",
          "[J] The first thing you notice about Ushi Okushima is her laugh. It fills the room with pure joy. This rainy afternoon, she sits comfortably wrapped in a blue kimono. Her thick hair is combed back from her suntanned face, revealing alert green eyes. Her smooth hands lie folded peacefully in her lap. At her feet sit her friends, Setsuko and Matsu Taira, cross-legged on a tatami mat drinking tea.",
          "[K] Ushi has recently taken a new job. She also tried to run away from home after a dispute with her daughter, Kikue. A relative caught up with her in another town 60 kilometers away and notified her daughter. Not long ago, she started wearing perfume, too. When asked about the perfume, she jokes that she has a new boyfriend. Predictable behavior for a young woman, perhaps, but Ushi is 103.",
          "[L] With an average life expectancy of 81 years for men and 87 years for women, Okinawans are among the world's longest-lived people. This is undoubtedly due in part to Okinawa's warm and inviting climate and scenic beauty. Senior citizens living in these islands tend to enjoy years free from disabilities. Okinawans have very low rates of cancer and heart disease compared to seniors in the United States. They are also less likely to develop dementia in old age, says Craig Wilcox of the Okinawa Centenarian Study.",
          "[M] A lean diet of food grown on the island and a philosophy of moderation - 'eat until your stomach is 80 percent full' - may also be factors. Ironically, this healthy way of eating was born of hardship. Ushi Okushima grew up barefoot and poor; her family grew sweet potatoes, which formed the core of every meal. During World War II, when the men of the island joined the army, Ushi and her friend Setsuko fled to the center of the island with their children. 'We experienced terrible hunger,' Setsuko recalls.",
          "[N] Many older Okinawans belong to a moai, a mutual support network that provides financial, emotional, and social help throughout life. Ikigai may be another key factor. The word translates roughly to 'that which makes one's life worth living,' and it is something that is different for each person. 'My ikigai is right here,' says Ushi with a slow sweep of her hand that indicates her friends Setsuko and Matsu. 'If they die, I will wonder why I am living.'"

        paragraphs: [
          "[A] It was just after 9 p.m. on June 18, 2004, at an observatory in Arizona, in the United States. Astronomer David Tholen was scanning the sky for asteroids when he noticed an object headed toward Earth. He and his colleagues hoped to take a closer look later that week but, unfortunately, were prevented by rain. By the time the team finally got another look at it, they realized they had a problem. The object was a large asteroid, which they named Apophis, after the Egyptian god of evil. Bigger than a sports arena, it comes frighteningly close to our planet every few years. By December, Tholen had calculated that the chance that Apophis would smash into Earth on April 13, 2029, was one in 40.",
          "[B] Alarm about the threat started to spread. Then, on December 26, 2004, a real catastrophe struck: the Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The public forgot about Apophis. Meanwhile, astronomers had found earlier images of the asteroid. The extra data enabled them to calculate its orbit, and they discovered that it would actually fly safely by Earth in 2029. However, this alarming scenario started a race among scientists to find solutions to the threat of large objects striking Earth.",
          "[C] Every day, tons of dust from comets and pieces of asteroids the size of grains of sand burn up in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Most days, a piece or two of rock or metal - the size of an apple or bigger - actually makes contact with Earth. Yet it's unlikely you'll ever be struck by a meteorite. Very few meteorites are ever known to have hit a person. In 1954, a grapefruit-sized rock bounced off Ann Hodges's radio and hit her as she lay on her sofa near Sylacauga, Alabama, in the United States. She escaped with only a bruised hip and wrist.",
          "[D] Since then, there have been some spectacular near misses. On August 10, 1972, an object the length of a car and weighing 150 tons traveled through the upper atmosphere. Hundreds of people saw its bright trail that sunny afternoon as it crossed the sky from Utah, in the United States, to Alberta, Canada, before flying back out into space. On March 22, 1989, a rock measuring 300 meters across came within several hundred thousand kilometers of Earth, which - in astronomical terms - is uncomfortably close.",
          "[E] There is evidence that, in the past, massive comets or asteroids have struck Earth's surface. Thirty-five million years ago, a 3-kilometer wide rock smashed into the ocean floor, 160 kilometers from what is now Washington, D.C., leaving an 85-kilometer-wide crater buried beneath Chesapeake Bay. Another giant rock called Titan - 10 kilometers in diameter - smashed into the Gulf of Mexico around 66 million years ago, unleashing thousands of times more energy than all the nuclear weapons on the planet combined. 'The whole Earth burned that day,' says Ed Lu, a physicist and former astronaut. Three-quarters of all life forms, including the dinosaurs, went extinct.",
          "[F] Astronomers have identified numerous asteroids big enough to cause a catastrophe for the entire planet. None is on course to do so in our lifetimes, but there are many smaller asteroids that could strike - with devastating effects - in the near future. On June 30, 1908, an object as big as a 15-story building fell in Tunguska, a remote part of Siberia. The object - an asteroid or a small comet - exploded several kilometers before impact, burning and blowing down trees across 2,000 square kilometers. Clouds of tiny particles of dust and ice filled the sky. The particles reflected the sun's light onto the Earth, and for days people in Europe could read newspapers outdoors at night. More recently, in 2013, a 20-meter meteor exploded over Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, injuring dozens of people on the ground. It was the largest object to enter the Earth's atmosphere since Tunguska.",
          "[G] The next time a large object falls out of the sky, we may be taken by surprise - though an early-warning system for near-Earth objects has recently been put into place. Sky surveys - like the one done by Tholen - are also helping to fill the gap. 'Every couple of weeks,' says Lu, 'we're going to be finding another asteroid with, like, a one-in-a-thousand chance of hitting the Earth.'",
          "[H] Within decades, the world's leaders may be faced with a dilemma: what to do about an incoming space object. Few experts are giving this much thought, according to NASA astronomer David Morrison. 'The number would roughly staff a couple of shifts at McDonald's,' he says.",
          "[I] Ed Lu - one of these few experts - is working on a plan that employs a spaceship to deflect asteroids. 'We were originally thinking about how you would land on an asteroid and push it,' he says. 'But that doesn't work well.' If the surface isn't solid, you have trouble landing or keeping anything on it. Moreover, asteroids are always rotating.",
          "[J] Pulling the asteroid along would be much easier. 'Rather than having a physical line between you and the thing you're towing, you're just using the force of gravity between them,' Lu says. A nearby spacecraft would pull the asteroid off course very slowly but steadily, using only gravity. Just a slight change in course could mean missing Earth by tens of thousands of kilometers.",
          "[K] The drawback to Lu's plan is that it would work only for asteroids up to a few hundred meters across that could be engaged far from Earth. Russian scientist Vadim Simonenko and his colleagues concluded that the best way to deflect a larger asteroid up to 1.5 kilometers wide would be to explode a nuclear bomb nearby. The explosion would destroy smaller rocks. For larger ones, the explosion would burn a layer of rock off the asteroid's surface. The expanding gas would act as a rocket motor, pushing the asteroid onto a new course.",
          "[L] As Apophis swings past Earth in 2029, there is a small chance that Earth's gravity will deflect the asteroid just enough to put it on a certain collision course with our planet on the next pass, in 2036. The odds are currently estimated at one in 45,000, so a strike is extremely unlikely. Meanwhile, astronomers will continue to track Apophis to learn if it will merely taunt us again, or actually strike."
