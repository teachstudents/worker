Yes, I have applied all the critical fixes, medium issues, and minor improvements identified in the debug report to create a fully functional, stable HTML file.

### **Summary of Fixes Applied:**
1.  **✅ Auto-Scroll:** Conversation container now automatically scrolls to the bottom as new bubbles appear.
2.  **✅ Voice Loading:** Improved voice initialization with recursive loading to prevent crashes on slow devices.
3.  **✅ CSS Overflow:** Fixed conversation container to scroll properly (`flex-start` + `overflow-y: auto`).
4.  **✅ Safety Checks:** Added validation for empty conversations and null voices.
5.  **✅ State Reset:** Navigation buttons now properly reset conversation indices and TTS state.
6.  **✅ Memory Management:** Speech synthesis is properly cancelled when navigating away.

Here is the complete, corrected code:
